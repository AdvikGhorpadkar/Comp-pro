  The three most important thing you need to know is : Always keep a mask & sanitiser with you. Also maintain social Distancing.
  <br>
 
 </p>
 <p1 style ="font-family:'Montserrat'">
  <centre><h2><u><i>Sanitiser</i></u></h2></centre>
  <h2><img src="1_Male-Hands-Dispensing-Hand-Sanitiser.jpg" width="600" height="400"></h2>
  Always use a sanitiser containing 70% alcohol, as this will only be effective.
<br> <br>
Alcohol attacks can destroy the envelope protein that surrounds some viruses, 
<br> <br>
including coronaviruses. This protein is vital for a virus’s survival and 
multiplication.
<br> <br>
But a hand sanitiser needs to be at least 60% alcohol in order to kill most viruses.
<br> <br>
 Hand sanitisers with less than 60% alcohol were also found to be less effective at 
 <br> <br>
 killing bacteria and fungi and may only reduce the growth of germs rather than killing 
 <br> <br>
 them outright.

<br>

  <p2 style ="font-family:'Montserrat'">
  <centre><h2><u><i>Mask</i></u></h2></centre>
  <h2><img src="mask 2.jpg" width="600" height="500"></h2>
  Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives. Masks reduce potential
  <br> <br>
  exposure risk from an infected person whether they have symptoms or not. People wearing
  <br> <br>
  masks are protected from getting infected. Masks also prevent onward transmission 
  <br> <br>
  when worn by a person who is infected.
  <br> <br>
  Within wider environments where the virus is spreading, masks should be worn by the general 
  <br> <br>
  public in settings where it is not possible to maintain at least 1 meter from others.
  <br> <br>
  Examples of these settings include indoor locations that are crowded and have poor ventilation,
  <br> <br>
  public transport and places of high population density – among others.
  <br> <br>

  In enclosed settings, especially where there is poor ventilation, it is also very important
  <br> <br>
   to increase the rate of air change, reduce recirculation of air and increase the use of 
   <br> <br>
   outdoor air.
</p2>
<br>
<p3 style ="font-family:'Montserrat'">
  <centre><h2><u><i>Social Distancing</i></u></h2></centre>
  <h2><img src="social-distancing-6-feet-graphic-002-CO.jpg" width="600" height="500"></h2>
  To practice social or physical distancing, stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from 
  <br> <br>
  other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces.
  <br> <br>
  Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive 
  <br> <br>
  Actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19
  <br> <br>
  COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sunlight,
  <br> <br>
  humidity, and the type of surface. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by 
  <br> <br>
  touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth,
  <br> <br>
  nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
  <br> <br>
  Social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected
  <br> <br>
  people outside the home.
