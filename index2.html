<b>1. Citric fruits</b>
<br><br>

<br><br><br>

Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells,
<br>
which are key to fighting infections.
<br><br>
Almost all citrus fruits are high in vitamin C. With such a variety to 
<br>
choose from, it’s easy to add a squeeze of this vitamin to any meal.

<br><br><br><br>
<b>2. Broccoli</b>
<br><br>
<img src ="broccoli.jpg" width="600" height="600">
<br><br><br>
Broccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with 
<br>
vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fiber and many other antioxidants,
<br>
 broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your plate.

<br><br><br><br>
<b>3. Garlic</b>
<br><br>

<br><br><br>
Early civilizations recognized its value in fighting infections. Garlic may
<br>
 also slow down hardening of the arteries, and there’s weak evidence that 
 <br>
 it helps lower blood pressure.
<br><br>
Garlic’s immune-boosting properties seem to come from a heavy concentration 
<br>
of sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>4. Ginger</b>
<br><br>

<br><br><br>
Ginger is another ingredient many turn to after getting sick. Ginger may
<br>
 help decrease inflammation, which can help reduce a sore throat and 
 <br>
 inflammatory illnesses. Ginger may help with nausea as well.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>5. Turmeric</b>

<br><br><br><br><br>
You may know turmeric as a key ingredient in many curries. This bright
<br>
 yellow, bitter spice has also been used for years as an anti-inflammatory
 <br>
  in treating both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
